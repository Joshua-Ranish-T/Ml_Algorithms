# 🤖 ML Algorithms — Implementation & Understanding

This project showcases a collection of **core Machine Learning algorithms** implemented from scratch and/or using popular libraries like **scikit-learn**. It is designed to help learners understand the inner workings of ML models by visualizing and coding each step interactively through a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📚 What's Inside

The notebook covers foundational machine learning algorithms across **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning categories. Each section includes:
- My understanding explanation
- Clean code implementation
- Visual examples or plots
- Evaluation metrics
  
### 🔍 Basics for ML
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**
  
### ✅ Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**

## 🧠 Goals

- Help you **understand ML algorithms** through visual and code-based walkthroughs.
- Provide a **starting point** for beginners to get hands-on with model development and training.
- Demonstrate how algorithms work under the hood by optionally avoiding black-box libraries.
